      <description>An illustration conveying a child&amp;rsquo;s dream, as strange as those can be. I wanted the owl to be slightly terrifying, but also fearfull of the boy. And part of the environment, as if it&amp;rsquo;s hiding there for a long while.
                         This time I spent some more time refining the watercolor underlayer; instead of opting for one color I added some nuances in the way the light reveals certain yellows, while keeping the shadows warm and dark.</description>

      <title>Stuck in Eternity</title>

      <description>I wanted to bring the world of my recent drawings to life, so I decided to make a single scene with some animated elements in it, looping endlessly. The goal was to convey a sense of time standing still, or being &amp;lsquo;stuck in eternity&amp;rsquo;.
First I made a couple of thumbnails and notan sketches of the image I had in my head, to get a feeling of the atmosphere. I then transfered to drawing on A3 sized paper.</description>

      <title>Old Friends</title>

      <description>I bought some new paper and grabbed a 2B pencil to draw this one. The 4B in my previous drawings tends to smudge a lot and it&amp;rsquo;s hard to draw details with the relatively soft graphite point.
The scenery in this drawing is based on some old ruins of a little factory in an area I occasionally walk in. I imagined a small mechanical critter living there that is friendly towards an old man who frequents the sight.</description>

      <title>Imagine a Sandcastle</title>

      <description>The sandcastle always intrigued me: a structure made out of material (sand) which inherently crumbles quickly over time. Yet as a child, one can imagine entire worlds inside such a simple form &amp;ndash; during such an objectively short amount of time. This is a little ode to that sentiment.

      <description>I sketched the main character from the character design workshop I attended last month and decided to create a little illustration from it. The colours and shapes in the background were made digitally.
I took some inspiration from abstract block prints as well as Koji Morimoto&amp;rsquo;s crazy drawings in terms of the usage of colour, but I was cautious not to overdo it.

      <title>Character Design Workshop: Module 1</title>
      <link>https://www.jessemanschot.nl/post/character-design-workshop-module-1/</link>

      <description>Last month I participated in an online character design workshop, taught by Anne Hoberg. It consisted of two modules; design principles and acting &amp;amp; posing.
In the first module we got to learn all about how to construct appealing characters and breaking it down into basic design principles.
We were assigned homework to finish three characters: a protagonist, sidekick and antagonist.
I quickly got stuck when I tried to draw the characters out of nothing, directly onto the paper.</description>
