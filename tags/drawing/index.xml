      <description>The sandcastle always intrigued me: a structure made out of material (sand) which inherently crumbles quickly over time. Yet as a child, one can imagine entire worlds inside such a simple form &amp;ndash; during such an objectively short amount of time. This is a little ode to that sentiment.

      <description>I sketched the main character from the character design workshop I attended last month and decided to create a little illustration from it. The colours and shapes in the background were made digitally.
I took some inspiration from abstract block prints as well as Koji Morimoto&amp;rsquo;s crazy drawings in terms of the usage of colour, but I was cautious not to overdo it.

      <title>Character Design Workshop: Module 1</title>

      <description>Last month I participated in an online character design workshop, taught by Anne Hoberg. It consisted of two modules; design principles and acting &amp;amp; posing.
In the first module we got to learn all about how to construct appealing characters and breaking it down into basic design principles.
We were assigned homework to finish three characters: a protagonist, sidekick and antagonist.
I quickly got stuck when I tried to draw the characters out of nothing, directly onto the paper.</description>
