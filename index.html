      Love is the blackest of all plagues. You know, it’s funny how you can tell when people are in love. Like I can’t stand you being a bank robber. That’s what love is. But that we don’t sleep together doesn’t mean I don’t love you. I thought you weren’t afraid of love? The measure of love is to love without measure. When we say we’re in love... what does it mean? It’s love. It’s not Santa Claus. And what’s “love” in Latin? God is love! Normally you see a room from a certain angle. Then you climb up and look down and everything is different. Being in love is like that. It’s the most used word in the world and it doesn’t mean a thing. And you? Is there a love in your life? Maybe the poets are right. Maybe love is the only answer. I think I love you. I don’t guess people’s hearts got anything to do with a calendar. Love is a game. Love is meaningless. Love, love, love, love, love, love.
